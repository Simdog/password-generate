# password-generate
For this assignment we had to work in javascript to generate a random password
we had to create a prompt for users to answer questions that led to the password being generated
we were checking for password length, upper case or lower case, numbers, and special characters.
we had to create a variable that stored those information then generated a password based on the users answer
Utilized psuedo coding to help with the process
Enjoy

    After they answer, check to make sure one of the criteria was selected (1 has to be true)
